## 👦 About me

Hey! I’m Pavan — originally from the USA 🇺🇸 and now hanging out in Austin, Texas 🌵.

I spend most of my time solving problems with automation.  
By day, I work in the SRE/DevOps world… and somewhere along the way I got obsessed with things like **n8n, AI agents, clean UI flows, and making systems run themselves**.

I’m the kind of person who sees a repetitive task and immediately thinks:  
“Yeah, that should definitely be automated.” 😅

I also run a small **AI automation agency** where I help businesses set up:
- AI agents that actually do things  
- n8n workflows that save hours  
- Smooth, simple tools that make work… not feel like work  
- Little UIs and dashboards that tie everything together

I like building stuff that feels:
**simple • fast • useful • and kinda fun to use.**

Always experimenting, always automating, always learning something new.
